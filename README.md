# Dusty Light

Another VSCode light theme

Should support most main languages however I obviously am unable to test everything, so I stuck to my main scope.

## Why

I just don't think there is a large variety in the light themes, so why not?

**Why Dusty Light?** I dunno, my names Dustin, I commonly get called Dusty as my nickname, so why not. (Probably the same reason I have a library called DustyJs too)

## Contributing

I will happily make a dark version if requested

Feel free to open a PR for stuff you find, or simply report it via the github issues so I can also take a look at it.
