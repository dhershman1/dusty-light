# Dusty Light

Another VSCode light theme

I built this theme because when I first wanted to switch to the light side, I found that most of the themes out there were super jarring. So I found them hard to use and stick to. Which led me to build this, a nice mixture that allows your to enjoy the main benefits of a light theme, without the jarring white out most come with.

Should support most main languages however I obviously am unable to test everything, so I stuck to my main scope.

Each color simply changes the accent coloring of the UI The syntax highlighting will remain the same between each theme
